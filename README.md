# User Registration and Profile Page

This is a sample app that demonstrates a user registration form and a profile page using React, Material-UI, and React Router.

The project consists of the following files:

- `App.js`: The main component that sets up the routing and provides the user context.
- `Login.js`: The component that renders the user registration form.
- `Profile.js`: The component that renders the user profile page.
- `UserContext.js`: The user context that stores the user data.
- `index.js`: The entry point of the application.

## Features

- User registration form with input validations for first name, last name, email, password, and confirm password.
- Redirects to the profile page upon successful registration.
- Profile page that displays the user's first name, last name, and email.
- Responsive design using Material-UI's responsive grid system.
- Error handling for form validation and empty fields.

## Testing

#### Process

The tutorial was tested through manual testing, where the code was executed, and the output was observed to ensure its correctness and functionality. The testing process involved the following steps:

1. _Code Execution_: The code was executed in the appropriate environment.
2. _Observation of Output_: The output generated by the code was observed, including any logs or error messages.
3. _Error Handling_: If any errors or unexpected behavior were encountered, appropriate modifications were made to the code to resolve them.
4. _Validation of Functionality_: The output was compared against the expected results to verify the correctness of the code.

Although formal tests were not written, manual testing provided insights into the behavior and performance of the project. It allowed for quick feedback and iterative improvements during the development process.

## Deployment

This project was deployed using Netlify, a popular platform for hosting and deploying web applications. The deployment process involved the following steps:

1. Connect GitHub Account: The project repository was connected to Netlify by linking the GitHub account associated with the project.
2. Select and Configure Repository: The specific repository containing the project code was selected in the Netlify dashboard. Configuration options such as build settings, environment variables, and branch selection were configured as required.
3. Build and Deploy: Netlify automatically triggered a build process whenever changes were pushed to the selected branch in the GitHub repository. The build process involved compiling the NextJS and TypeScript code into optimized assets ready for deployment.
4. Live Deployment: Once the build process was completed successfully, the project was deployed on a live system accessible via a unique URL provided by Netlify. The deployed project took advantage of Netlify's CDN (Content Delivery Network) for fast and efficient content delivery.

Netlify simplified the deployment process by seamlessly integrating with GitHub and providing an intuitive interface for configuration and monitoring
